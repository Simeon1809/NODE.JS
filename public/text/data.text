Hi everyone!

Here's my assignment: Write about 200 words telling a visitor from another country what he/she should or should not do in your country. 

I'm sorry for so many mistakes, but I can't better.  :(

In German are allowed serious discussions in a public. They like to talk about politics or philosophy, but please, avoid small talk. This is what they don't like. If you want to talk to someone, then you should be formal. You should use "Sie" in conversations, they let you know when you can use "du". If somebody introduce you to someone, so you should give your hand to handshake. If you don't do this, it would be rude. If you want to take a phone call, then you should introduce you with your name. After you did it, you can ask them, whether they can speak in English. Please, don't go as a pedestrian on a red marked bikeway. It could happen, that someone collide with you or they yell at you. German People like to be punctual, when you don't want be disgrace oneself, you should be punctual. Don't get drunk, even if the Alkohol flows well. You shouldn't start eat before the host don't say "Guten Appetit". One more thing, what you should consider. Be don't unwary, if you cross the road. No one of natives do it. You could get a penalty. Enjoy German and have fun. 

Thanks for helping!
